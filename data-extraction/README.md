## Data Extraction

To successfully construct a machine learning pipeline we need to collect the data we are going to train on.
The data extraction is organized here by the different use case.


In many introduction to machine learning examples the data is pre-extracted, and sometimes even pre-cleaned.
Here we will show some ways to collect the initial data.
Once the initial training data has been extracted, we will continue on downstream with data cleaning, and
may later do some data augmentation.
