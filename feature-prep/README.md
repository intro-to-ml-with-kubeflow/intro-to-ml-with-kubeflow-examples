Feature preparation is the task of converting the data into features
suitable for our machine algorithms. What makes a "feature" suitable
depends on the algorithm used.

In the `tft` directory we show feature prep using Tensorflow Transform. At the time of writing this only supports Python 2 and has limited support on non-GCP platforms, but it is rapidly improving in both areas.
